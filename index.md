My objective is to study and apply geotechnical and earthquake engineering to design safer urban infrastructure, 
focusing on seismic hazard assessment, ground deformation, and liquefaction mitigation.

## About-me
I am an undergraduate civil engineering student with a strong interest in geotechnical and earthquake engineering.  
My long-term goal is to contribute to safer and more resilient cities by improving how we understand and design against 
ground shaking, liquefaction, and ground settlement.  

I am especially interested in connecting traditional geotechnical design with modern data-driven methods such as 
machine learning–based ground response prediction and real-time monitoring of soil behavior during earthquakes.  
Through coursework and projects using AutoCAD, surveying, and basic numerical analysis, I am building the foundation 
needed to work on advanced seismic design and geotechnical analysis in graduate school and industry.

### **KSCE, Korean Society of Civil Engineers — Capstone Design Competition Presentation**  
*Cheongju, S.Korea | 14th Nov. 2025*

#### **Rutting Mechanism Analysis**
Analyzed rutting caused by asphalt softening under high temperatures, repeated axle loads, and subgrade stiffness reduction.

#### **AI Detection & Prediction**
Built YOLO-based thermal hotspot detection and XGBoost models to predict high-risk rutting periods using climate and traffic data.

#### **Signal-Linked Cooling Control**
Designed a Jetson Orin–based automated spray cooling system optimized by traffic congestion patterns and signal cycles.

#### **Experimental Validation**
Conducted field-simulated tests demonstrating a **5–10°C** surface temperature reduction and noticeable mitigation of rutting progression.

#### **Research Significance**
Emphasized the system as a proactive, AI-driven smart pavement management model enhancing road resilience under heat, moisture, and post-earthquake weakening.
