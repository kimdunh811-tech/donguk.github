My objective is to study and apply geotechnical and earthquake engineering to design safer urban infrastructure, 
focusing on seismic hazard assessment, ground deformation, and liquefaction mitigation.

## About-me
I am an undergraduate civil engineering student with a strong interest in geotechnical and earthquake engineering.  
My long-term goal is to contribute to safer and more resilient cities by improving how we understand and design against 
ground shaking, liquefaction, and ground settlement.  

I am especially interested in connecting traditional geotechnical design with modern data-driven methods such as 
machine learning–based ground response prediction and real-time monitoring of soil behavior during earthquakes.  
Through coursework and projects using AutoCAD, surveying, and basic numerical analysis, I am building the foundation 
needed to work on advanced seismic design and geotechnical analysis in graduate school and industry.
